# Event Causality Identification via Generation of Important Context Words
==========

This repo contains our PyTorch implementation for the paper [Event Causality Identification via Generation of Important Context Words](https://aclanthology.org/2022.starsem-1.28.pdf). 


## GenECI

1. Prepare data\
Download the desired corpus (ESL, Causal-TB) and put it in folder ```.\datasets```\
and run:
```
python datasets/preprocessor/preprocessor.py
```

2. Train model:
```
sh ESL_bash.sh
```
or
```
sh CausalTB_bash.sh
```
Note \
Need th√≠s code is still under review
